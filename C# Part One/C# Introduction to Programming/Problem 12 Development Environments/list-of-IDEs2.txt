Integrated development environments (IDEs)
  1. Eclipse – this IDE contains compiler and interpreter. 
It can be used to develop applications in other programming languages like C++, JavaScript, 
Python and est. Its software development kit (SDK) is meant for Java developers, which can install 
plug-ins for the Eclipse Platform and can write and contribute their own plug-in modules.
  2. Lazarus – this is a free cross-platform visual IDE, which supports dialects of Object Pascal. 
It’s used to create native-code console and graphic user interface applications for the desktop, for mobile devices, 
function libraries, web applications and others. An application, created by using Lazarus, can potentially compile 
and execute on any platform for which a Free Pascal compiler exists. 
  3. Net Beans – it is IDE for developing primarily with Java, but also with other languages like C++ and HTML. 
The Net Beans platform allows different applications to be developed from a set of modular software 
components called modules. This platform simplifies the development of Java Swing desktop applications.   
  4. Softbench – it’s one of the first plug-in IDE tool based on the UNIX operating system. 
Some of the ideas of this IDE are common today in other well-known IDEs, like Eclipse. Basically the main
ideas are: tools and data can reside on many different systems, integrated help facility, tool slots and common user interface.
  5. KTechlab – it’s an Open Source IDE for electronic and PIC microcontroller circuit 
design and simulation. Also this is a circuit designer with auto-routing and a simulator of common 
electronic components and logic elements. But this environment is not fully completed, so the work on it continues.
